Machines
* Have a group name - this is so similar things can be grouped - e.g. "General MIDI", "Drum Machines", "Synths" etc
* Have a display name that cant be edited e.g "Roland TR6s"
* Have a user name that can be customized e.g "My other stupid drum machine"

Sources/Destinations

* Each machine has 1..N sources
* A source is something that can be dragged and dropped onto a performer/expander button
* A destination is where the source has been places (Which module and the index)
* Not all sources must be placed(dragged) on to the module 
* If a source has not been placed, then a boolean flag for that source named "active" is set to false
* If a source HAS been placed, then "active" is set to true

Settings

* Each machine has settings - "eg midi channel for all sources"
* Each source has is own settings - "e.g setting cc value OR OVERRIDING MIDI CHANNEL .. eg if someone has a particular track on a different channel etc"
	* IF a source has the same setting as the machine, the source will override the machine setting
        * IF someone changes a setting (e.g change MIDI channel 10 -> 4) AND the sources also have midi channel as a setting, then all sources need to be iterated and any sources with a MIDI channel 10 would be changed to 4 as per the "global machine setting" - this means if someone has customized a midi channel, then its preserved
* If a setting (either for machine or source) has a boolean flag "cannot_edit: true" then it should not be shown in the UI and it cannot be changed
